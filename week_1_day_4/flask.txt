Flask is a framework

Flask does not care about file structure, it gives lots of options for setting up and connecting to database

you can not have django 2 and django 3 installed at the same time on the same machine to use with python. 
A virtual environment can be used to get around this. Typically with python in real world applications (using 3 projects 1 work 1 hobby 1 future would each have a different python install) you would be using a vitual environment

we will use pipenv for our vitual environment tool

create a separate virtual environment for each project we work on from now on

pip install pipenv

type pip3 list to check for install (maybe mac only?)

creat flask folder
pipenv install flask
should creat virtual environment
shows folder for environment on machine (generally dont need to mess with this)

pipenv shell
    activates virtual environment (hej_flask or whatever name of virtual each is) this proves its installed and running

deactivate command turns off environment exit is the command

Pipfile and Pipfile.lock will show up in VS code...dont change these or touch them. Config files for the vitual environment

server.py(file name doesnt really matter but this is the most common name)

from flask import Flask #from flask module import Flask class

app = Flask(__name__)       #creating instance of Flask class and assigning to app. need double under name for "good reasons"

# a route is a specific endpoint on a website that we access specific information from
@app.route('/')#decorator is a function that modifies another function
def index():        
    return 'welcome 2 my webbed site :3'        #just return a string for now


#has to go at bottom of page
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)


python server.py    #entered into flask window

server ip address is shown which is my computer only i can access
typing it into the browser may have issues depending on computer spyware protection
should show what we typed if it works

names of functions used should be relative to what you are doing

when using vs code and u save, the development server looks for changes and assumes you want it to run. 

could run thru vs code however they advise against it
