UQ
Unique - Wouldnt worry too much abou this

Unsigned - Check for ID (dont have to click for assignments) Keeps things not negative

ZF

Auto-increment - Check for ID.

Default/Expression
Generally dont need to touch. If making a salary for example, you could put 40000 in this column as the starting salary for all employees. 

created_at should have a Default/Expression of: NOW()
updated_at should have a Default/Expression of: NOW() ON UPDATE NOW()

One to One join
SELECT * FROM customers 
JOIN addresses ON addresses.id = customers.address_id;

Or

SELECT * FROM customers 
JOIN addresses ON customers.address_id = addresses.id ;

Or

SELECT * FROM customers JOIN addresses ON customers.address_id = addresses.id ;

They all do the same thing!
