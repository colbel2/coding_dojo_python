create a folder to store everything in

create a server.py file in that folder

create a folder inside the folder you are working in and name it templates

inside templates make an index.html file

open the command prompt and navigate to the folder you want to work in
cd .// will jump up a folder in the command window


type 

pip install pipenv

then type

python -m pipenv install flask flask-bcrypt pymysql


to launch the virtual environment and access from browser type

python -m pipenv shell

to exit the environment type

exit

then type in python server.py to launch the browser

once the environment is live you can acces it on a web browser by going to 

localhost:5000/

to build your server.py page:

from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def sjfhdgh():
    return jfdklahglks


At the very bottom of the server.py page you must have 
if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

So if you want to link a html template you need the render_template at the top
then in an @app.route you need to return render_template.

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return render_template("index.html")    #the string inside of render_template MUST be called whatever you named the HTML file
