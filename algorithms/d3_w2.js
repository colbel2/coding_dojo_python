// bookIndex(input) -> input is an array of integers, in order
// those integers represent pages in a book where a certain term is found
// output is a string representing a listing of those pages in a book's index
// an input of: [58, 104, 105, 106, 192, 194, 195, 196]
// leads to an output of: "58, 104-106, 192, 194-196"
// input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18]
// output: "1-5, 8-12, 15, 17-18"

// suggestion: break this into two parts, or maybe even two
// functions - get your array of integers and turn it into an array
// of strings, then turn that array of strings into a single string
// [58, 104, 105, 106, 192, 194, 195, 196]
// ["58", "104-106", "192", "194-196"]
// "58, 104-106, 192, 194-196"
// also a suggestion: remember that you can modify your for loop iterator
// during your loop! you can add to or subtract from i at any point
// also also: remember that loops can go within loops - while in for,
// for in for, while in while, etc.

function bookIndex(input) {
    // code here
    // somewhere in this code, call buildString()
}

function buildString(input) {
    // a secondary function you may want to call
